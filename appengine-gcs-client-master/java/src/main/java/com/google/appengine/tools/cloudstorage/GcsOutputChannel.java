/**
 * A writable byte channel for writing data to Google Cloud Storage. Write calls will either place
 * the data into an internal buffer or make a synchronous RPC call to write the data.
 *
 *  Implementations of this class may further buffer data internally to reduce remote calls.
 *
 * Calling {@link #close()} will cause any buffers to be flushed and all data written to be stored
 * durably. After this point the file can be read but no longer written to. Not calling close will
 * result in the file not ever being written durably and it will automatically disappear from Google
 * Cloud Storage.
 *
 *  This class is serializable, this allows for writing part of a file, serializing the
 * GcsOutputChannel deserializing it, and continuing to write to the same file. The time for which a
 * serialized instance is valid is limited and determined by the Google Cloud Storage service. Note
 * that this is not intended as a way to create multiple GcsOutputChannel objects for the same file.
 * Even if one serializes and deserialzes this object, only one of the original instance or the
 * deserialized instance may be used going forward. Using both in parallel will result in undefined
 * behavior.
